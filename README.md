## Problem Statement

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health concern, posing a substantial burden on
populations worldwide. The infectious disease, primarily caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, primarily affects the lungs and spreads through respiratory droplets. In 2019, an
estimated 1 crore people worldwide fell ill with TB, resulting in 14 Lakh deaths. The
prevalence is particularly pronounced in regions with high population density and limited
access to healthcare, contributing to the persistence of TB as a major global public health
challenge.

In India, the situation is particularly alarming, with the country accounting for a quarter of the
world's TB burden. In 2019 alone, India reported 27 Lakhs TB infections, and more than 4
Lakhs individuals succumbed to the disease. The magnitude of the problem is compounded
by factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and limited healthcare infrastructure, which
contribute to the challenges of TB control and prevention in the country. Efforts to combat
TB globally and in India involve a combination of diagnostic innovations, treatment
accessibility, and public health initiatives to alleviate the widespread impact of this infectious
disease.
