## Problem Statement

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health concern, posing a substantial burden on
populations worldwide. The infectious disease, primarily caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, primarily affects the lungs and spreads through respiratory droplets. In 2019, an
estimated 1 crore people worldwide fell ill with TB, resulting in 14 Lakh deaths. The
prevalence is particularly pronounced in regions with high population density and limited
access to healthcare, contributing to the persistence of TB as a major global public health
challenge.

In India, the situation is particularly alarming, with the country accounting for a quarter of the
world's TB burden. In 2019 alone, India reported 27 Lakhs TB infections, and more than 4
Lakhs individuals succumbed to the disease. The magnitude of the problem is compounded
by factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and limited healthcare infrastructure, which
contribute to the challenges of TB control and prevention in the country. Efforts to combat
TB globally and in India involve a combination of diagnostic innovations, treatment
accessibility, and public health initiatives to alleviate the widespread impact of this infectious
disease.

## Dataset:
We have used Tuberculosis (TB) Chest X-ray Database to train  and evaluate our model.

#### [Tuberculosis (TB) Chest X-ray Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset)
A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors from Hamad Medical Corporation and Bangladesh have created a database of chest X-ray images for Tuberculosis (TB) positive cases along with Normal images. In our current release, there are 700 TB images publicly accessible and 2800 TB images can be downloaded from NIAID TB portal[3] by signing an agreement, and 3500 normal images.
